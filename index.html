			<h2> TigerDrive </h2>
			<p> TigerDrive is the University of Missouri's first autonomous vehicle build project. It is entirely student led, developed, and maintained. The vehicle is a 1997 Chevy S-10 that has been converted to an electric vehicle by Mizzou Eco Racing. The vehicle is capable of nothing currently, and I'm going to slap a photo carosel in this bitch.</p>
